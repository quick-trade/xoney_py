# What is Xoney?

Xoney is a flexible framework for creating trading systems based on the results
of statistical hypothesis testing.

Xoney differs from the mass of other frameworks and libraries in that the 
functionality is extensive, conveniently extended and supplemented if 
necessary. You don't need to start a webserver or run your code through a terminal to use Xoney.

The main approach to creating trading systems is data analysis, because 
intuitive trading is too unpredictable, and untrained models are suboptimal.
